# Documentation of the use of API Management (APIM) and Function Apps with ODW  

[DaRT process](#dart-process)  
[Folder structure example](#folder-structure-example)  
[Authorisation flow](#authorisation-flow)  

## High level architecture  

![architecture](../../images/apim-function-apps.drawio.svg)  

## Key points to note

- All Function Apps will be on a Premium plan (e.g. EP1) to allow VNET integration
- All Function Apps will use the same App Service Plan
- A system assigned managed identity will be created for each Function App
- All Function Apps will be imported into API Management (APIM) service for security
- APIs will be organised into logical products within APIM
- Subscription keys will be required for all APIs
- oAuth will also be used to authenticate against each API
- APIM will be integrated with Azure Entra ID
- The APIM developer portal will be used to access API documentation and to subscribe to APIs
- A JWT validate policy will be applied to all APIs as part of auth flow
- Azure Key Vault will be used to store subscription keys and service principal secrets used to call the APIs
- Subscription keys and SPN secrets to be rotated on a regular basis (tbc) using Azure DevOps pipeline
- Clients to fetch keys as needed from Key Vault (key rotation process to be finalised and tested)

## Service User process  
### Goal
Back Office (ODT) wants to send and receive data from ODW via Service Buses. 

### Process
The end-to-end process has been automated as follows.

1. An **Azure Function** will be triggerred whenever the Back Office sends a new message to their **Service bus**. This message is expected to be in json format.
2. **Azure Function** will write this data as a json blob in a **Storage Account** at `odw-raw/Service-Bus/Service-User/{rand-guid}.json`.
3. A Storage Event trigger `tr_odw_raw_service_user` will be fired as a result of this write operation which then will trigger a **Synapse Pipeline** `pln_service_user_main`.
4. This pipeline will process and ingest the new data in Standardised, Harmonised, and Curated layers within the ODW and as a final step, publish the data the ODW **Service Bus** at `service-user` topic.
5. In addition to the new data coming from the Back Office, ODW will also process/host legacy Service User data obtained from **Horizon**. This data is originally present at `odw-raw/Horizon/2023-05-19/CaseInvolvement.csv`.
6. Back Office will be able to subscribe to this topic and consume the processed data.
7. For other entities like NSIP, we will be able to re-use the above process.

### Service User architecture

### Key notes
- Make sure the Function App and the Storage Account are in the same VNET to allow communication.
- Make sure that the Azure Data Factory application (search Azure Data Factory in managed identities when doing a role assignment) has the right role assigned (EventGrid EventSubscription Contributor) in the Subscription to be able to publish the trigger.

## DaRT process  

 - Managed identity is created for DaRT Function App
 - Managed identity is granted read access to relevant objects in Synapse that it needs to query. This can be done within Synapse itself, e.g.  

 ```sql
-- create a login first for the managed identity
use master;
create login [pins-dart-app] from external provider;
print 'login created'

-- create a user on the required database (or multiple)
use odw_curated_db;
create user [pins-dart-app] for login [pins-dart-app];
print 'user created';

-- add the user to a role
ALTER ROLE db_datareader
ADD MEMBER [pins-dart-app];
print 'user added to role';
 ``` 
- Managed identity need read access to files in the storage account container holding the data. E.g. for the odw_curated_db it would be **pinsstodwdevuks9h80mb/odw_curated** with permission role assignment of **Storage Blob Data Reader**  
- The DaRT app is based on an http trigger with a SQL binding.  
    1. Client makes GET request to endpoint
    2. Function App receives request and sends SQL query to Synapse
    3. Synapse returns response in json format for client to consume

The app code will look something like this, using python v2 programming model. The SQL query can be held in a separate file ease of management; this is just an initial example.   

```python

import azure.functions as func
import logging
from azure.functions.decorators.core import DataType
import json

app = func.FunctionApp()

@app.function_name(name="GetCases")
@app.route(route="getcases", methods=["get"], auth_level=func.AuthLevel.FUNCTION)

@app.generic_input_binding(arg_name="cases", type="sql",
                        CommandText="SELECT TOP (10) * FROM [odw_harmonised_db].[dbo].[casework_case_info_dim]",
                        CommandType="Text",
                        ConnectionStringSetting="SqlConnectionString",
                        data_type=DataType.STRING)

def get_cases(req: func.HttpRequest, cases: func.SqlRowList) -> func.HttpResponse:
    rows = list(map(lambda r: json.loads(r.to_json()), cases))

    return func.HttpResponse(
        json.dumps(rows),
        status_code=200,
        mimetype="application/json"
    )
```

 ## Folder structure example

Function App code and required files should be placed in a folder structure as follows, within the ODW-Service repo root folder.  

Terraform can then reference the required files to create the Function Apps. 

```bash

functions:.
├───DaRT
│       .funcignore
│       dart_query.sql
│       function_app.py
│       host.json
│       local.settings.json
│       requirements.txt
│
├───ODT
└───Service_User
```
